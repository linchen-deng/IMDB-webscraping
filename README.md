# IMDB-webscraping
This project in done in collaboration with David Crbonello and Uttam Bhetwel

We are interested in the diffrence in word that appeared in titles by each movie genre, so we webscraped all the titles by each genre
to see if there is any interesting pattern.

Then we move on to web scraped other movie information including ratings, scores, runtime, certificate type. We ran a comparative 
analysis across all the genres we investigated.
